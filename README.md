### How It's Made:

This projects is build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. After the player indicates their choice, their choice is sent as a request to the server. Their request is processed on the back-end where the computer's randomized choice is generated and the computer's choice is compared to the player's choice. Next, a winner is declared. The server packages the player's choice, the computer's choice, and who the winner is, into an object. The object is sent as a response back to the front-end where the data is used to render content to the DOM.


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use Node.js to create a server on the back-end.
